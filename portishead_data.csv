Tempted in our minds
Tormented inside lie
Wounded and afraid
Inside my head
Falling through changes

Did you know when you lost?
Did you know when I wanted?
Did you know what I lost?

Empty in our hearts
Crying out in silence
Wandered out of reach
Too far to speak
Drifting unable

Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be ee, a woman
It's all I wanna be is all woman
For this is the beginning of forever and ever
It's time to move over"

Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just...
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman
From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Thru this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over, and give us some room
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman
So don't you stop, being a man
Just take a little look from our side when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
It's all I wanna be is all woman
For this is the beginning of forever and ever
It's time to move over"

The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I havе left
Is my memories of yesterday
Oh, these sour times

Of innocence, descent, or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives

I can't find my way
Been searching, but I have never seen
A turning, a turning from deceit

'Cause the child rose as life
Tried to reveal what I could feel

I can't understand myself anymore
'Cause I'm still feeling lonely
Feeling so unholy

'Cause the child rose as light
Tried to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone

I'm fooling somebody
A faithless path I roam
Deceiving to breathe this secretly
A silence, this silence I can't bear

'Cause the child rose as life
Tries to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone, oh no
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone

A lady of woe
A lady of woe"
